            <div class="story">
                <p>Fried rice has played a large role in my life, quite literally.
                  When I was on Broadway I got to be part of the cast for The Lion King,
                  which was a huge honor considering how much I loved the movies as a child.
                  I was just a member of the ensemble, so nobody actually recognized
                  me on stage or even knew I was on there.</p>
                <p>This really made me question what I was doing with my life.
                  I put countless hours of dedicated time, effort, and literal blood,
                  sweat, and tears into pursuing this career path and being better
                  than the competition. Making it to Broadway was the end goal;
                  the light at the end of the tunnel. Growing up, I thought that
                  if I could just make it to Broadway, I would die a happy man.
                  Literally nothing else seemed like such an exciting, rewarding,
                  or satisfying goal. However, now that I somehow made it, I just
                  dance and sing in the background for a couple hours every night.
                  That's it. All of that buildup, all of that hard work, just to
                  sing and dance a little bit.</p>
                <p>After one particularly rough showing, I felt this way a lot more
                  than usual. As I hopped in the cab to head back to where I was
                  staying, I saw someone on the street eating fried rice. I suddenly
                  craved fried rice like nothing else in my life. Instead of going home,
                  I went to Panda Express. As I walked in, the smells were overwhelmingly
                  exciting. I realized that THIS was my true passion; THIS is where
                  I wanted to be. I then immediately quit Broadway and became a
                  full time Panda Express worker. Here's a recipe for fried rice
                  that is NOT the recipe from Panda Express.</p>
