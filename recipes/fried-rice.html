            <div class="story">
                <p>Fried rice has played a large role in my life, quite literally. When I was on Broadway I got to be part of the cast for The Lion King, which was a huge honor considering how much I loved the movies as a child. I was just a member of the ensemble, so nobody actually recognized me on stage or even knew I was on there.</p>
                <p>This really made me question what I was doing with my life. I put countless hours of dedicated time, effort, and literal blood, sweat, and tears into pursuing this career path and being better than the competition. Making it to Broadway was the end goal; the light at the end of the tunnel. Growing up, I thought that if I could just make it to Broadway, I would die a happy man. Literally nothing else seemed like such an exciting, rewarding, or satisfying goal. However, now that I somehow made it, I just dance and sing in the background for a couple hours every night.That's it. All of that buildup, all of that hard work, just to sing and dance a little bit.</p>
                <p>After one particularly rough showing, I felt this way a lot more than usual. As I hopped in the cab to head back to where I was staying, I saw someone on the street eating fried rice. I suddenly craved fried rice like nothing else in my life. Instead of going home, I went to Panda Express. As I walked in, the smells were overwhelmingly exciting. I realized that THIS was my true passion; THIS is where I wanted to be. I then immediately quit Broadway and became a full time Panda Express worker. Here's a recipe for fried rice that is NOT the recipe from Panda Express.</p>
