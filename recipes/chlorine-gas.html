                <p>Cleaning with chemicals can certainly be a cause for concern! Chlorine is a toxic, yellow-green gas that's one of today's most heavily used chemical agents. Many household cleaners contain chlorine, including automatic dishwashing detergents, some laundry detergents, chlorine bleach, chlorinated disinfectant cleaners, mildew removers, and toilet bowl cleaners. As for mixing products, more isn't always better; unless a chemist is the one mixing, it's recommended that household cleaners aren't combined. Depending on the mixture, chlorine may be released, which can lead to poisoing and may even be fatal. If, while cleaning, someone inhales or ingests chlorine or starts to experience physical symptoms, stopping use of that particular product and seeking care from a medical professional is advised.</p>
                <p>When using cleaning products that contain chlorine, it's good to be aware of any symptoms that may signal chlorine poisoning. The symptoms, which can result from mild to moderate exposure, include:</p>
